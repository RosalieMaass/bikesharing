# Bikesharing

## Overview of Analysis
- In this module we analyzed data from the citibike bike rental program in New York City to see if a similar program would be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. 
- We looked at the original CSV that contained rider information, rental time duration, pick up and drop off locations, distance and bike information. 
- We created a number of charts in Tableau to assess this data further.
- The information will then be presented to potential shareholders.

## Results
- We made a number of illistrations in Tableau to analyze the citibike data. Here is what we found:
- The majority of bikes are rented for between 5-30 minutes.
- The majority of renters are male.
- The busiest time of day for rentals is from 8-9am and 5-7pm Monday through Friday and about 10am-6pm Saturday and Sundays.
- Most customers use the subscription service. 
- The top starting locations are similar to the top ending locations

## Summary
- In summary, there is a lot of data. We can assume most of it will align with a program in Des Moines, IA.
- We can predict that the busiest times will be rush hours on weekdays (7-8am and 5-7pm) and a little more evenly spread out on weekends. 
- The majority of users are likely to be male and use the subscription model. 
- We can also predict that the starting and ending locations of riders will be about the same locations.
